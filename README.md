This is a voice-based interactive machine that asks questions and records the answers of the interviewee. 
It starts by asking some predefined questions which were processed along with their answers.
As it records the speech (answer) given by the interviewee and converts the speech to text for further analysis and evaluation. 
We used sentence similarity with the cosine metric, to evaluate the answer of interviewees using sentence similarity.
